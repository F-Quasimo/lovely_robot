## introduce
This respo is created on a whim. someday i thought about if i have a robot like BB8 that should be cool.
so i bought a raspberry 4B with wheels under it and machine hand on it. It is far away frome BB8. Doesnt matter, i like it.

### how to calibrate camera?
I write a calib tool in '/tools' but it is ugly and imcomplete. anyway, it works for single camera calib. I finish this tool at the dead of night with dizzy and sleepy. forgive me.
It looks like this:
the first two input is used to config the camera info, then click the button, change the capture picture save to "which folder" and click opencamera will open the camera u select in row 1. shows:
